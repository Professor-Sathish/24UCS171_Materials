## üß™ Testing Strategy (TDD Approach)

### Testing Framework
Each version includes a simple testing framework:

```c
// Simple assertion macros
#define ASSERT_EQUAL(expected, actual, message) \
    do { \
        if ((expected) != (actual)) { \
            printf("FAIL: %s - Expected %d, got %d\n", message, expected, actual); \
            return 0; \
        } \
    } while(0)

#define ASSERT_TRUE(condition, message) \
    do { \
        if (!(condition)) { \
            printf("FAIL: %s\n", message); \
            return 0; \
        } \
    } while(0)
```

### Test Categories:
1. **Unit Tests** - Individual function testing
2. **Integration Tests** - Component interaction testing
